# Color-Image-Segmentation-using-Granular-Computing-Technique
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze [1]. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries in images. Segmentation should stop when the Region of Interest (ROI) in an application have been isolated. An example is, if the image application aims to recognize the iris in an eye image, then the iris in the eye image is the required ROI. Segmentation extracts the Regions of Interest (ROI) from the image to form a similar region by classifying pixels on some basis to group them into a region of similarity. project implemented as windows standalone application
